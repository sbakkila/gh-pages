        <h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              In a large pot with just enough water to cover them, boil potatoes with their skins on. The skin helps the potato not too absorb access water. (Dry potatoes are good. Water potatoes are bad.) Boil for about 20 minutes or until fork tender. Over-boiling will cause potatoes to become mushy and too wet.
            </li>
            <li>
              Peel potatoes: Peel boiled potatoes, removing any brown spots that might be below the skin.
            </li>
            <li>
            Rice potatoes: Using a potato ricer, rice peeled potatoes. If they appear watery at this point, allow them to rest on a dishtowel to absorb excess water.
            <li>
              Make a well: Using your hands, scoop out the center of your mound.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add egg: Break egg into the center of the well. Beat the egg with a fork.
            </li>
            <li>
              Incorporate ingredients: Using the fork, slowly start to pull in flour and potato to mix ingredients.
            </li>
            <li>
              Knead dough: Pull together ingredients and knead to form dough. Be careful not to over-knead. Be weary of adding flour at this point. Too much flour will give you hard gnocchi.
            </li>
            <li>
              Roll into ropes: Roll each piece by gently pushing with fingers spread. The goal is to make an evenly-distributed rope. For shorter, heavier gnocchi, roll dough into thick ropes and cut into 1-inch pieces. For thinner gnocchi, roll longer ropes.            </li>
            </li>
            <li>
              Cut dough ropes: Using a pastry cutter or non-serrated knife, cut dough ropes into 1-inch pieces. Cut ends at an angle.            </li>
            <li>
              To cook: Gently shake away any excess flour and place finished gnocchi in a large pot of salted boiling water. Cook gnocchi until they float to the top, about 2-4 minutes. Gently remove them with a slotted spoon, drain very well. Toss them in a saucepan with your favorite sauce and cook together for about 2 minutes. Do not wait longer than 45 minutes to cook gnocchi or they will begin to stick to each other.              </li>
            </li>
